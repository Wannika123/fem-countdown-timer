## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- vite
- TypeScript
- 3D CSS animation
- I also generate the shimmering stars that appear randomly in the sky.

### What I learned

- This project introduces me to 3D CSS, and I think building a website that has perspective is really interesting.
- I also learned more about `Date` object, though I can't say I'm totally comfortable with it.

### Useful resources

- [code-along countdown timer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x00P_1meF6c&t=2631s) - I think I would have never figured out how to do the flip animation without this tutorial.
- [CSS 3D article](https://vinceumo.github.io/devNotes/CSS/css-3d-scrolling-on-the-z-axis/) - This article explain 3D CSS really well. But as the author seems to be a bit of a designer himself, for those who don't have much knowledge about perspective, I would recommend to research about basic perspective as well. That's what I did too before I fully understood this article.
